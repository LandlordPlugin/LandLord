Landlord
========

Landlord is a bukkit plugin for players to prevent against griefing, stealing, and animal kills in a simplified manner.

Purpose
---------
Landlord aims to keep the minecraft experience simple and fluid for players while also protecting their land. The idea is for this plugin to protect player builds with minimal gameplay interference, while also allowing them to tweak the protection details in a simple and user-friendly way.

Functionality
---------------
Players claim land in chunks at a time for a configurable cost. That's all a player needs to do to protect their builds within that chunk. Each area of claimed land will have a very basic permissions system that users can choose to tweak with but also not touch if it isn't desired.
